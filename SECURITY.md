# Security

This file describes the controls protecting accounts on peoplegrowthafrica.com, how to rotate a
secret, how to inspect the audit log and how to report a problem.

## What is implemented

**Passwords**

- Hashed with bcrypt at cost 12 (roughly 250 ms per check), on top of a SHA-256 base64 digest so
  bcrypt's 72 byte input limit cannot be used to make two long passwords equivalent.
- Checked against the Have I Been Pwned range API using k-anonymity: only the first five characters
  of the SHA-1 hash leave the server. A breached password is refused at signup and at reset. If the
  API is slow or unreachable (1.5 second timeout) the password is allowed through.
- Login answers with one message and one status for an unknown email and a wrong password, and
  spends the same time on both paths so timing cannot reveal which emails are registered.

**Sessions**

- A JWT signed with HS256 (jose), 7 day expiry, with the issuer `peoplegrowthafrica.com` and the
  audience `pga-auth` set and checked. The algorithm is pinned, so a token claiming `none` or a
  different algorithm is refused.
- Carried in an httpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Path=/ cookie, and Secure whenever the request is https.
  The name is `__Host-session` on the production deployment and `session` everywhere else, so a
  subdomain cannot overwrite it in production.
- The token carries `token_version`, which is re-checked against the database on every
  authenticated request, together with the account's role. Raising the version ends every session
  at once, which is what the password reset flow and "log out on all devices" do.
- Logging out expires the browser's cookie. Sessions are self contained, so a token copied out of
  the cookie before that moment stays valid until it expires; reset and log out on all devices are
  the actions that revoke a token that is already in someone else's hands.
- The server refuses to start when `JWT_SECRET` is missing or shorter than 32 characters.

**Requests and input**

- Every endpoint validates its body with zod strict schemas: unknown keys are rejected, strings are
  trimmed and length capped, emails are lowercased, and the role must be exactly `talent` or
  `employer`.
- Bodies over 8 KB are refused with 413 before parsing.
- State changing requests must come from the site's own origin (the Origin header is compared with
  the request host), on top of the SameSite cookie.
- SQL is parameterised everywhere (`sql.query(text, params)`); no statement is built by
  concatenating user input. Table and column names are chosen in `api/_lib/db.ts`.
- Redirect targets come from a fixed server side allowlist, so no request value can turn into an
  open redirect.
- User supplied values are rendered as text; nothing uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

**Abuse and audit**

- Rate limits on signup, login, forgot password, reset password, resend verification, verify email
  and account deletion, counted per IP, per email, per token and per user as appropriate. Upstash
  Redis when `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` are set, otherwise a per
  instance counter that logs a warning. A spent budget returns 429 with `Retry-After`.
- Identifiers are pseudonymised before they reach the limiter, so neither Redis nor memory holds a
  raw email address or IP.
- `auth_events` records signup, login success and failure, logout, log out everywhere, password
  reset requested and completed, email verified, verification resent and account deleted, with a
  keyed hash of the IP address instead of the address itself. A refused attempt is recorded as
  `rate_limited:<bucket>`, for example `rate_limited:login-ip`: the per IP buckets carry the same
  keyed hash as the other rows so they line up, and the others carry no address at all because
  their key stands for an email, a token or a user id rather than an IP.
- Passwords, tokens, cookies and request bodies are never logged. Error lines mask anything that
  looks like an email address.

**Headers and transport**

- `vercel.json` sets Strict-Transport-Security (`max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains`),
  X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, X-Frame-Options DENY, Referrer-Policy
  strict-origin-when-cross-origin and a Permissions-Policy denying camera, microphone, geolocation,
  payment and USB.
- The Content Security Policy currently ships as `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`. See the
  limitation below: the site still has one inline script, so an enforcing policy would break it.
- Auth responses set `Cache-Control: no-store` and there is no wildcard CORS: the endpoints are
  same origin only.
- Emails are only sent with `RESEND_API_KEY`; without it the link is printed to the console outside
  production only, never in production.

## Rotating JWT_SECRET

`JWT_SECRET` signs session cookies. Treat it like a password to the whole site.

1. Generate a new value: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`.
2. Update it in the Vercel dashboard for Production, Preview and Development (`npm run setup:auth`
   can add it for Production and Development when the CLI is linked).
3. Redeploy. **Rotating the secret signs every user out immediately**, because no existing cookie
   can be verified any more. Users simply log in again; nothing else is lost.

The same applies to deleting the secret: the endpoints refuse to run without it.

## Switching to a least privilege database role

The migration script creates tables as whatever role `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` points at, which is
usually the Neon owner role. To have the application run as a narrower role:

```sql
CREATE ROLE pga_app LOGIN PASSWORD 'use-a-long-random-password';
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO pga_app;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON users, talent_profiles, employer_profiles, auth_tokens TO pga_app;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON auth_events TO pga_app;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE auth_events_id_seq TO pga_app;
```

Then point `DATABASE_URL` (the pooled string only, never `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`) at the new role.
Note that this role cannot run `npm run setup:auth`, which needs DDL rights, so keep the owner
string for migrations. On Neon's free plan, creating an extra role is allowed but the role still
inherits the plan's limits, and pooled connections may require the role to exist on the branch
Neon created for the integration. If the grants above are rejected, stay on the owner role and note
it as a known gap rather than forcing it.

Verify encryption in transit by keeping `sslmode=require` in `DATABASE_URL`; Neon encrypts data at
rest on its side.

## Querying the audit log

Run these in the Neon SQL editor. Nothing in `auth_events` contains a password, a token or a raw IP
address.

Failed sign in attempts in the last 24 hours, grouped by source:

```sql
SELECT ip_hash, count(*) AS attempts, min(created_at) AS first_seen, max(created_at) AS last_seen
FROM auth_events
WHERE event LIKE 'login_failed%' AND created_at > now() - interval '24 hours'
GROUP BY ip_hash
ORDER BY attempts DESC;
```

One account's security history, newest first:

```sql
SELECT created_at, event
FROM auth_events
WHERE user_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email <hello@peoplegrowthafrica.com> with the steps to reproduce it. Please do not open a public
issue or test against other people's accounts. We will acknowledge within 3 working days and tell
you when a fix ships.

## Known limitations

- The Content Security Policy is report-only until the inline service worker script in `index.html`
  is moved to its own file or given a hash.
- Rate limiting falls back to per instance counters until Upstash credentials exist, which a
  distributed attacker can partly work around.
- Breach checking fails open if Have I Been Pwned is unreachable.
- Password reset requests take marginally longer when the email exists (the reset email is sent
  before responding); the identical response and the 3 per hour per email limit make this
  impractical to use for enumeration.
- Preview deployments share the production database unless a Neon branch is attached, so test
  signups would be real rows.
- A plain logout cannot revoke a token that was already copied off the device, because the session
  is a self contained JWT with no server side record. Closing that gap means storing one row per
  session and deleting it on logout, which is cheap here because every authenticated request
already reads the database once to check `token_version`.
