# The People Growth Africa Website

**The public website for People Growth Africa — HR and people consulting for growing African businesses.**

**[www.peoplegrowthafrica.com](https://www.peoplegrowthafrica.com)**

## What this is

Everything that makes up the website lives in this folder — every page, every article, every photograph and every brand colour.

You don't need to write code to keep the site up to date. This guide explains what's here, how to change the words and pictures, and how to publish an update to the live site.

The live website is **https://www.peoplegrowthafrica.com**.

## What's on the site

| Page | Web address | What visitors find there |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Home | `/` | The main introduction: what we do, our service areas, client outcomes, FAQs and a "get in touch" section. |
| Events | `/events` | Webinars, masterclasses and mentorship cohorts, with a registration form. |
| Blog | `/blog` | The full knowledge hub: all published articles in one place, with search and category filters. |
| Article | `/blog/article-name` | A single article, with the author, reading time and related reading. |
| Book a consultation | `/consultation` | The booking calendar where visitors request a session. |
| Not found | any other address | A friendly page shown when someone follows a link that doesn't exist. |

The site also publishes `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt` and `llms.txt`, which help Google and other search engines find and understand the pages. These are written automatically every time the site is built — you never need to edit them by hand.

## Changing the words and pictures

Almost everything you'd want to update sits in three files, and you only ever change the text **inside the quotation marks**.

| What you want to change | Where to find it |
| :--- | :--- |
| Blog articles (titles, text, author, date) | `src/data/posts.ts` — **9 articles** published |
| Events and programmes | `src/data/events.ts` — **5 programmes** listed |
| The 15 service areas | `src/data/services.ts` |
| Wording on a page itself | `src/pages/` — one file per page |
| Photographs, logos and social share image | `public/images/` |

**When editing these files, keep the surrounding quotes and commas exactly as they are.** The website reads them like a form — if you remove a comma the page will refuse to load. If you're unsure, ask before saving.

### Adding a new article

1. Copy an existing article in `src/data/posts.ts`, from its opening brace `{` to its closing `},`.
2. Paste it at the top of the list and change the words. Give it a new, lower-case `slug` — that becomes the web address, so `slug: 'my-new-article'` becomes `/blog/my-new-article`.
3. Save, preview the site to check it looks right, then publish.

New articles appear on the blog page, in the sitemap, and in the search-engine files automatically. Nothing else needs updating.

### Pictures

Keep photographs under about **300 KB** each and around **1600 pixels** wide. Large pictures are the main reason websites feel slow, especially on mobile data, and most of our readers are browsing on a phone.

The four brand logos are already optimised. If they ever need regenerating, a script is included:

```bash
npm run images
```

## Seeing the site on your own computer

You'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) once (the "LTS" version is the right one). After that, open a terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
npm install     # one time only — gathers everything the site needs
npm run dev     # starts the site on your computer
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser. This is a private preview — only you can see it, and nothing you do here affects the live website.

Leave it running while you work: as soon as you save a file, the preview updates by itself. Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal when you're finished.

To double-check the final version before publishing:

```bash
npm run build     # prepares the finished version
npm run preview   # shows the finished version at http://localhost:4173
```

---

## Publishing your changes

Once you're happy with a change, send it to the live site:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
git push
```

The website rebuilds itself within about a minute. Refresh the live site to confirm your change appeared.

If something looks wrong after publishing, don't panic — every published version is kept, so the previous one can be restored.

## Brand colours and fonts

Use these exact values so the website stays consistent with our other materials.

| Colour | Value | Where it's used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Deep Green | `#0F6E56` | The main brand colour: headers, banners, buttons. |
| Brand Green | `#1D9E75` | Buttons and links when you hover over them. |
| Mint | `#E1F5EE` | Soft backgrounds behind cards and labels. |
| Terracotta | `#C4773B` | Warm accent colour for highlights and calls to action. |
| Cream | `#F2EDE4` | Quiet background sections. |
| Charcoal | `#1A1E1B` | Body text and dark sections. |

**Fonts:** `Fraunces` for headings and `DM Sans` for everything else. Both are free from Google Fonts.

### Brand assets

<div align="center">

| Logo (dark) | Logo (light) | Icon (dark) | Icon (light) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="public/images/logo-black.png" width="160" alt="Logo dark" /> | <img src="public/images/logo-white.png" width="160" alt="Logo light" /> | <img src="public/images/icon-black.png" width="60" alt="Icon dark" /> | <img src="public/images/icon-white.png" width="60" alt="Icon light" /> |
| `logo-black.png` | `logo-white.png` | `icon-black.png` | `icon-white.png` |

</div>

These live in `public/images/`. The dark versions are for light backgrounds, the light versions for dark backgrounds.

## Good to know

* **Always share links with `www.`** Our address without `www` redirects to the `www` version, so `www.peoplegrowthafrica.com/events` is the correct form. Search engines are told the `www` version is the official one.
* **Every page has its own title and description.** These are the blue headline and grey text that appear in Google results. They're set automatically, so you don't need to write them.
* **The site works offline.** Once someone has visited, their browser keeps a copy so the site still opens on a weak connection.
* **The website is free to host.** It's a set of static files, which is why it loads quickly and costs nothing to serve.

## Getting help

If a page won't load, if you'd like a new kind of page, or if anything here doesn't make sense — reach out before editing. A small question now is much easier than fixing a broken page later.
